# Disclaimer test-net #

The public-permissioned LACChain network offered by LACChain is currently at a test-net stage. The access to this network is described in this GitHub. The LACChain team is currently defining a road-map with both technology and legal requirements to release networks in production. From now on, we will refer to the LACChain test-net as ¨The Network¨.

Any natural or legal person that uses or operates The Network becomes a User. The User agrees to these terms and acknowledges that The Network is at an early stage of development. The User acknowledges and accepts that the use of The Network is entirely at the User’s sole risk and discretion.

To use The Network, The User must be authenticated, guaranteeing that every regular/access node operating The Network is associated to a physical or legal person. Every regular node must indicate the contact information of the natural person that is responsible and accountable for the operation of the regular node, including name and e-mail. 

The User acknowledges and agrees that has an adequate understanding of the blockchain technology and the programming languages. The User also understands the risks associated with the use of The Network, which could present interruptions or malfunctions as it is at a est-net stage.  

The user understands that all the information and materials published, distributed or, otherwise, made available on The Network are provided with no guarantee by the Allies,  Members and Users of the LACChain program. Despite The Allies will struggle to offer robust technology, at this est-net stage they are not responsible nor accountable for the reliability of The Network.

All the content related to The Network is provided on an ‘as is’ and ‘as available’ basis, without any representations or warranties of any kind. All implied terms are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law. No party involved in, or having contributed to the development of The Network, including but not limited to IDB, IDB lab, everis, ConsenSys, NTT Data, io.builders, LegalBlock and any of their affiliates, directors, employees, contractors, service providers or agents (The Parties Involved) accept any responsibility or liability to Users or any third parties in relation to any materials or information accessed or downloaded via The Network. 

The User acknowledges and agrees that all the Parties Involved are not responsible for any damage to the User’s computer systems, loss of data, or any other loss or damage resulting from the use of The Network.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall The Parties Involved have any liability whatsoever to any person for any direct or indirect loss, liability, cost, claim, expense or damage of any kind, whether in contract or in tort, including negligence, or otherwise, arising out of or related to the use of all or part of The Network.

The User understands and accepts that none of the physical and/or legal persons operating a core (validator or boot) node in The Network and, therefore, being part of the consensus protocol, is legally committed to maintain those nodes. When a percentage of these nodes are suddenly turned off, the network may cause iinterruptions of service. The User operating a regular/access node and any third party using the network through The User´s regular/access nodes understands that LACChain will not be either responsible nor accountable for any malfunction or damage caused by the disconnections of the core nodes.

The User will not run any application or solution in The Network when The Network is a necessary component for the either application or the solution. 

The User will not run any application or solution nor register any information or data in The Network that incurs illegal activities or practices that can be considered against the Law.

The User must preserve the data privacy of all the physical and legal persons whose information is directly or indirectly registered in The Network through The User´s regular node.

The User is not allowed to promote the use of The Network for commercial or institutional purposes without including the following disclaimer:

*All the operation and use of the LACChain test-net blockchain network by ________ (The User) is carried out under the entire responsibility and discretion of ________ (The User). Under no circumstance, any responsibility or accountability is extended to any other physical or legal person operating the network, or the community behind LACChain. The LACChain blockchain network is currently at a test-net stage and, therefore, it must not be used for applications or solutions in production, or for monetization purposes. The expected use of the network is for testing and learning purposes, as there could be occasional malfunctioning or interruption of service.
Over the coming months, LACChain will develop and incorporate the legal policies, the governance frameworks and the technology upgrades for the release of the pre main-net and the main-net that will enable the operation in production.*
